          At Mind Cache AI, we believe in the power of self-reflection and

          What is a Focus Area?
        </div>
        <div>
          A Focus Area is a theme or subject that you choose to explore in depth
          through your reflections. It's a space where you can concentrate your
          thoughts, feelings, and observations, allowing for a structured yet
          flexible approach to personal introspection.
        </div>
        <div className="text-lg font-semibold text-black my-4">
          Why are Focus Areas Important?
        </div>
        <div>
          By creating Focus Areas, you provide structure to your introspective
          journey. This can range from specific aspects of your life you wish to
          understand better, to broader themes of mental and emotional
          well-being. Focus Areas help organize your thoughts, making your
          reflections more meaningful and insightful.
